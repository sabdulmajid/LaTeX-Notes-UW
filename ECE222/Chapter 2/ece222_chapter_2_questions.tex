\section*{Chapter 2 Questions - Assignment Questions for Week 2}

\subsection*{2.1}
[2.1] [5] <§2.2> For the following C statement, write the corresponding RISC-V 
assembly code. Assume that the C variables \texttt{f}, \texttt{g}, and \texttt{h}, have already been placed 
in registers \texttt{x5}, \texttt{x6}, and \texttt{x7} respectively. Use a minimal number of RISC-V assembly 
instructions.
\begin{verbatim}
f = g + (h - 5);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2.2}
[2.2] [5] <§2.2> Write a single C statement that corresponds to the two RISC-V 
assembly instructions below.
\begin{verbatim}
add f, g, h
add f, i, f
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2.3}
[2.3] [5] <§§2.2, 2.3> For the following C statement, write the corresponding 
RISC-V assembly code. Assume that the variables \texttt{f}, \texttt{g}, \texttt{h}, \texttt{i}, and \texttt{j} are assigned to 
registers \texttt{x5}, \texttt{x6}, \texttt{x7}, \texttt{x28}, and \texttt{x29}, respectively. Assume that the base address 
of the arrays \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are in registers \texttt{x10} and \texttt{x11}, respectively.
\begin{verbatim}
B[8] = A[i - j];
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2.4}
[2.4] [10] <§§2.2, 2.3> For the RISC-V assembly instructions below, what is the 
corresponding C statement? Assume that the variables \texttt{f}, \texttt{g}, \texttt{h}, \texttt{i}, and \texttt{j} are assigned 
to registers \texttt{x5}, \texttt{x6}, \texttt{x7}, \texttt{x28}, and \texttt{x29}, respectively. Assume that the base 
address of the arrays \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are in registers \texttt{x10} and \texttt{x11}, respectively.
\begin{verbatim}
slli x30, x5, 3 // x30 = f*8
add x30, x10, x30 // x30 = &A[f]
slli x31, x6, 3 // x31 = g*8
add x31, x11, x31 // x31 = &B[g]
ld x5, 0(x30) // f = A[f]
addi x12, x30, 8
ld x30, 0(x12)
add x30, x30, x5
sd x30, 0(x31)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2.5}
[2.5] [5] <§2.3> Show how the value \texttt{0xabcdef12} would be arranged in memory 
of a little-endian and a big-endian machine. Assume the data are stored starting at 
address 0 and that the word size is 4 bytes.

\subsection*{2.7}
[2.7] [5] <§§2.2, 2.3> Translate the following C code to RISC-V. Assume that the 
variables \texttt{f}, \texttt{g}, \texttt{h}, \texttt{i}, and \texttt{j} are assigned to registers \texttt{x5}, \texttt{x6}, \texttt{x7}, \texttt{x28}, and \texttt{x29}, 
respectively. Assume that the base address of the arrays \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are in registers \texttt{x10}
and \texttt{x11}, respectively. Assume that the elements of the arrays \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are 8-byte 
words:
\begin{verbatim}
B[8] = A[i] + A[j];
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{2.10}
Assume that registers \texttt{x5} and \texttt{x6} hold the values \texttt{0x8000000000000000}
and \texttt{0xD000000000000000}, respectively.
